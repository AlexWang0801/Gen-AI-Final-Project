## Overview

The **Gen-AI-Final-Project** explores advanced concepts in Generative Artificial Intelligence. It implements state-of-the-art models and techniques to solve complex problems in areas such as text generation, image synthesis, or emotion-driven AI. This repository is structured to aid both research and practical experimentation.

## Features

- Implementation of Generative AI models using Python.
- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualizations.
- Support for loading and preprocessing datasets.
- Modular and extensible code for training and testing generative models.
- Emotion-based model switching and fine-tuning (if applicable).

## UI instructions
- After inputting text, select duration then click on the analyze emotion button.
- When you run the model for the first time, click on the load MusicGen Model button. 
- Then click the Generate Music Based on Detected Emotions button, and enjoy the music!

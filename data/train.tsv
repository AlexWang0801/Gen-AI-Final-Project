If [NAME] gets 350M+ from anyone we should be glad we didn't get him.	19	ednrgfx
Truth. If he had time for another relationship, he has time to pay for it. 	3	eeo17rw
You can't just ignore [NAME]' cup wins though.	2	ed68a90
Crap. I need more Excedrin. STAT.	8	ef2d4r4

CW is available without Cable. But if your saying it doesn’t qualify as broadcast then I guess Kids WB never did	26	ed8eume
But it does? Admittedly it does take a couple days and a few friendly reminders	6	edfp9wo

[NAME] was actually asked whether he’s peaked by a Philly sportswriter last season. His response was pretty interesting:	26	ee6jq3a

Can you explain how she could block all three spots? I don’t think we understand.	5,6	eed7yj0
Yeah, right. [NAME] can marry [NAME] for that matter, as it seems only his genius is keeping her on the throne.	12	edghjfx

He sounds exactly like my type of dude looks wise, but woof. Nobody wants to be around someone that unstable. Glad you made it out alive.	26	ef1og6l
They make money to sit and talk to you there's no reason to feel like a burdon cause it's legit their job.	2	eet478g
That is true, yet that is a problem of the systematic exploitation in capitalism, not the fault of existence/birth per se. 	26	eemht17

Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!	14,16	eefftdp
[NAME] endorsed [NAME], for one epic fail in that regard. I prefer to make my own informed judgement call, thank you very much	14	edvbvsb

I want to see [NAME] and [NAME], fresh blood is gonna do us only good at this point	26	ednqyw5
Good to see this getting traction again. It really exposes [NAME] to be a useful idiot, and his supporters to be even dumber than that.	2,3	ed6fpvm
I want to taste their tears	7	edfm96v
Would have been faster to seal it and then pressurize the tube so the kitty gets shot out like a cannonball.	26	ed3oixx

Now you'll be more cautious of that in the future. Lessons were learned today son.	26	edt5gdd
Lmk if u come across anything	26	eeu0pv8

I believe the term is grill inspector	26	ef1r54h
I would pay money to see the security cam footage of that.	26	edd06wm
But why....specifically?	26	ee6uabc

i said first world :)	26	eec8tfu
If I got killed by someone while they're stunned I'd uninstall my game.	26	eeanhzk

Either of those scenarios make sense. I'm getting antsy I need some positive Steelers news haha.	0	edhxb3a
It’s fitting. All things Considered.	3	edvizmr
They're not going to read their UserVoice anyways. It's a PR stunt.	9	eegdb9r
It's not even that... just string in the water.	26	ee3axkv
eh, maybe. the tricky part is getting away with it.	26	eeuxpj2
lol, you dieded	0	efg47mv
Of course it was a smart move, it's only dumb if its the only move	2	ed6zcfj
Dude you really like The Strokes.	3,17	eddrt3j

Nobody expects you to finish the 10 string.	26	ed6jo3q
And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.	26	ee79sao
I bet he doesn’t line up for Daniels Donuts	26	edk00aw
We're out of the environment, it's ok.	22,26	edqy7bh

No wonder I can not use my Visa card in China. [NAME] is doing the right things. China must stop its unfair business practices.	3	ee28ent
Just curious, why would that matter? Acting is playing a role, so how is it important that the character and the actor match orientations? 	6	edahquu
I hear lyft is better	26	ee2grg0
I mean, let's not pretend [NAME] wouldn't be screaming murder if this happened at Spa instead of NVA	26	ee9c8ep
That would...hurt	2	eevtm0w
"I do recall him saying at some point that he was ""unsure"" whether he would vote for [NAME] or not (or something along those lines)."	26	ed28c06

Nah. Been over it pretty much since [NAME] said the Vikings did it too. Pretty hard to be mad when we were just as guilty.	23	ee5r309
Why else? Seems that it is just lack of imagination on your part.	6,26	ee8xgzm
Assault weapon are 26 ton weapons used by the nazis and Soviets during ww2 I think you're mistaking it for semi auto rifle	26	edkobdy

Oh god yes. Top quality cringe. Thank you for sharing	3,14	eemffjk
“Go for the sodas and ice cream” would be sufficient. No need to rag on the food.	26	eezn8ps
I'm assuming they sense the change but to translate it onto the screen for the audience they have to have them realize it	26	eeqqvgk
Reminds me of Ross Lake WA	21	eff01nz
I support the idea of punishing [NAME] without trying to injure [NAME].	3	edzy9yw
Once upon a time I got banned for a whole day because of bad behavior... Oh wait that was all of us...	24	edjnrah

Congrats, still waiting on getting called for an interview for another internal position. Applying around Christmas HR is so fucking slow.	14	ed8vjg3
I hate that attitude, as if it's every woman's, purpose, dream, and personal duty to reproduce.	2	ed0nh4l
I'm not sure why [NAME] would care about the backstop. Maybe he just wants to rile up the Tories.	5	efdnhxa
Alleviate' meaning what? Make my working life suck less?	2,6	ef7minl
[NAME] “sociopath”.	26	edgem7a
I’m okay with the “expecting mother’s” spots. It’s not a women thing, it’s a courtesy thing 	26	ef8kuwr

[NAME] is a nut; he has a rubber butt!	26	eeryj12
"I wish they can a option to change it back after the ""upgrade"" because it feels more like a downgrade"	19	edfeudx
[NAME] was absolutely awful in 15.	26	ef14quw
Completely understandable. Lots of players who are new and don't realize how big of a distraction that is	3	ee3pdwk
That's far from what happened and there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary of the circumstances of her death that it leaves no room for debate really.	24	effw1x7
It was pretty good, I didn't have the patience to see *all* the endings myself but spoilers exist on reddit for the curious (; 	6	eeafkqi

Everything in here I want but all we can do is pray to [NAME] for our wishes to come true	26	edp3mz1
I'm curious how he does in the counties you mentioned. The primary might end up being super close, but you know more than I do.	6	edkycop
Asides from the max number of choices each share, probably being shamed on the internet	26	eeptpbk
Didn't even notice until you *pointed* it out. I had a bit of a giggle.	21	edkjvw6
are you implying [NAME] throatfucked these cats	26	ee4r2px
Thanks for looking out but we will take our chances with this grave danger.	14	ed2qm4g

And you don't take delight in seeing the person you love in pain. Amen my dear!	17	ef6dheq
Now that you're saying it, it actually makes sense. I'll be really hurt, but if she makes him happy I can't stop him.	16	edi4dc2
I am sorry that you are experiencing such deep suffering and such pain. You matter in this world, and we would all be diminished without you.	23,24	edufsbp

Did you guys hear about the Pacers quiet start? Yeah, that's done, now.	26	eexo8bj
[NAME] said that it was recorded the monday after [NAME], that's why his voice is like that.	26	ed3cz1p
Eh, Level 7 is pretty serious. Give me my Massif and I'll survive anything.	2	eeuf8yg

Aye it's doing the rounds so I'm sure I'll see it today	26	eeffzfj
Didn't seem patronising to me.. just kids being kids when confronted with a guy banging on a drum.	26	eek3pju
That’s an insult to special needs people everywhere.	26	ef0q153
That sounds terrible! I get hay fever some years, I also have eczema and anxiety, all at once sounds like pure hell.	13	ee0yty6
I was living for him. Now he left me. I'm not gonna live anymore.	8,24	edk39nx
Damn.. fell for that one	2	ee2ijc5
[NAME] is a creeper and hangs out with underage girls n shit.	2,10	edo3o48
I mean, the whole point of this sub is to complain about not having a plate ...	21	ef7iw2e
There is always the risk of a team throwing him a stupid offer sheet. I still wish we would've thrown a max at [NAME].	7	eemdkbm
Feels good getting a number next to our name again.	16	eems49s
Could you point to a specific policy of [NAME] that was to the left of [NAME] on race please?	6	edwfasm
He would probably just treat the situation like A$AP Bari’s.	26	edjzps5
That sounds awesome actually	3	ed63gjd
I both loathe and applaud you	10	edus7g0
Why would she say something like that? What did you do	26	edipepb
There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.	9	ef5w7n3
You're trying too hard	26	ed4zd74

Okay, so that doesn’t really answer my question. Are you suggesting the liability will fall on the towing company with shitty or sketchy reviews? 	5,6	edtzcmr
I never thought about that. Good point. Cursed and wilted rose, unlike [NAME] rose emblem.	26	eerv0m6
That sub bans and deletes anything that's not flattering to [NAME]. Don't expect anything other than ideology and cult behavior from those idiots.	9	eedc1zq

[NAME]	26	eeeysz9
I feel personally attacked.	13	edpphav
I work from home and live with my daughters. It's so serene, but also a lot of fun because we have great times together.	16	eelrpk8

Is there a dress code for those runways? ( everyone is wearing dark colors then there is frank)	5,6	eed21hs
Only good ones.	26	ed9qozj
Funny thing is he kind of said just that jokingly in the [NAME] interview yesterday	0	ee4j0ev
>Cause they almost never hit anything. Very inaccurate. The benefit of fighting against a largely untrained adversary.	8	ef6c027
Not [NAME]! He had 0.9% kick to selfs so he'll probably keep bunging them in from the goal square and not getting any stats.	26	ee9e5hh
My favorite thing is when [NAME] gets the ball at the top of the key and every stands with their hands on their hips	17	efelb9c

Only if not being a [NAME] is a mental illness instead of a spiritual problem.	26	eezxxfd

Damn. Saving your post	26	ednnjj6
Ya, definitely gotta not feel like a [NAME] sometimes too. 	3	edaufiz

If it's all for [NAME] I'll forgive it.	26	eenypu6
Wow are you saying political agitators will drum up a controlled crisis and disseminate the edited video through a foreign fake twitter account	25	eepypj0
Damn some of these are so cringy that i almost downvote them, but realize that they are suppose to be terrible.	2	eem5ikm
Please elaborate on that story! Ive always been afraid of exactly this happening to me.	13	ee2kw21
I enjoyed that [NAME] kept saying [NAME] last name wrong over and over.	16	edq444f
No but the fact that it's even a possibility says a lot.	26	efgr0sg
